We take security seriously and are committed to maintaining the security of our project. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it as soon as possible.

### Steps to Report a Vulnerability

   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any relevant logs or screenshots.

2. **Do Not Share Publicly**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed. This helps us protect our users and the integrity of the project.

3. **Response Time**: We will respond to your report as soon as possible and will keep you updated on the progress of the fix.

## Secure Coding Practices

To help maintain the security of this project, we encourage contributors to follow these best practices:

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms, such as hashed passwords and secure tokens.
- **Authorization**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users have appropriate permissions.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies and monitor for known vulnerabilities using tools like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).

## Security Updates

We will provide security updates and patches as necessary. To stay informed about security-related updates, please watch the repository or check the [releases](https://github.com/VannySothea/fastapi-user-authentication/releases) page.
